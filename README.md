# Embedded-Workaround
  Bash script for embedded C programming

  This is a .sh file that will compile c files in the project, make the .map file, the .lss file, the .o files,
the .elf file and the .hex file that can be used to flash into a microcontroller.
  This script targets AVR microcontrollers.

This file is not meant to work as a plug-in, change it according to the project needs!
